# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a project from the Odin Project in which I was told to design an Etch-A-Sketch/Sketchpad-like web app. I learned how to create, modify, and style DOM elements by working on this object. Besides DOM manipulation, I also learned about utilizing callback functions. It was a very fun and exciting pursuit :)!
